## Features

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components, such as screens and widgets.
- **Domain Layer**: Manages business logic with the help of BLoC (Business Logic Component) patterns. Streams within repositories are used to facilitate communication between specific groups of BLoCs.
- **Data Layer**: Handles data fetching and storage, integrating with local storage solutions like SharedPreferences and Realm.

## State Management

BLoC pattern (via `flutter_bloc` package) is used for state management, leveraging streams within repositories to handle complex state interactions between different BLoC groups.

## Navigation

The app uses the `auto_route` package for seamless and scalable navigation.

## Error Handling

The application has its own hierarchy of errors and error handlers. Error handling is implemented throughout the application, including network-related errors and other types of exceptions.

## Logging

The `talker_flutter` package is employed for logging, providing efficient tracking and debugging of the appâ€™s operations. Navigation logging is also implemented to track navigation events.

## Data Storage

Two types of data storage are utilized in the application. For local data persistence, the app utilizes both `SharedPreferences` for simple key-value storage and `Realm` for handling complex data structures and relationships.
